                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>While trial-and-error learning is highly effective for skill development, learners frequently abandon their goals when faced with emotional setbacks from mistakes and failures. Growthmancer addresses this gap by providing a supportive, gamified environment where users can process negative emotions productively and maintain motivation throughout their learning journey.</p>

                    <h3>The Challenge</h3>
                    <p>Skill-learners value trial-and-error methods but struggle with handling negative emotions related to their failures, leading to abandonment of learning goals.</p>

                    <h3>The Solution</h3>
                    <p>A responsive web platform featuring personalized AI helper characters that guide users through structured lessons and reflections, transforming setbacks into growth opportunities.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="section">
                    <h2>Research & Discovery</h2>

                    <h3>Initial Research Goals</h3>
                    <p>I conducted research to understand the common pain points in skill-learning experiences, focusing on three key areas:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Common experiences:</strong> What universal challenges do skill-learners face?</li>
                        <li><strong>Learning effectiveness:</strong> Which methods work and which don't?</li>
                        <li><strong>Motivation factors:</strong> What drives persistence versus abandonment?</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
                    <p>I analyzed four educational platforms to identify market gaps:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Lesson structure:</strong> High demand for streamlined but comprehensive lesson flows</li>
                        <li><strong>User input:</strong> Opportunity for platforms that directly respond to user-specific problems</li>
                        <li><strong>Enjoyment:</strong> Fun, engaging experiences significantly improve retention and satisfaction</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>User Interviews</h3>
                    <p>I interviewed 5 skill-learners across different domains to understand their learning journeys.</p>

                    <h3>Key Insights</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Trial-and-error effectiveness:</strong> All participants found hands-on experimentation most valuable for improvement</li>
                        <li><strong>Emotional barriers:</strong> Users consistently struggled with negative self-talk and demotivation after setbacks</li>
                        <li><strong>Self-reflection value:</strong> Taking time to process and review experiences helped internalize learnings</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Synthesis: Affinity Mapping</h3>
                    <p>Through affinity mapping, I identified 9 core themes from user research, with <strong>Handling Unproductive Emotions</strong> emerging as the primary challenge alongside <strong>Trial-and-Error Learning</strong> as the preferred method.</p>

                    <h3>Point of View Statement</h3>
                    <p><em>"I'd like to explore ways to help skill learners emotionally navigate trial-and-error learning and practice because users who experience negative emotions when faced with failures still find this process helpful for skill learning."</em></p>

                    <h3>Key Learnings</h3>
                    <p><strong>About the Problem Space:</strong> Emotional barriers in learning are more significant than initially understood. The connection between trial-and-error learning and emotional resilience is crucial but underaddressed.</p>

                    <p><strong>About the Design Process:</strong> Early user testing revealed assumptions about familiar UI patterns that needed addressing. Visual metaphors for abstract concepts require explicit explanation during onboarding.</p>

                    <h2>Future Opportunities</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>AI Integration:</strong> The helper concept provides a natural foundation for implementing AI-powered personalized guidance and adaptive lesson content</li>
                        <li><strong>Enhanced Personalization:</strong> Further development of helper customization could deepen user emotional investment and identification</li>
                        <li><strong>Community Features:</strong> The town/collection concept offers opportunities for peer support and shared learning experiences</li>
                        <li><strong>Cross-Platform Extension:</strong> Mobile app development could support learning in real-time contexts where setbacks occur</li>

                    <h2>Reflection</h2>
                    <p>This project reinforced the importance of addressing the complete user experience, including emotional aspects often overlooked in educational technology. The research-driven approach revealed that technical learning solutions miss a crucial component: helping users process the inevitable negative emotions that arise during skill development.</p>

                    <p>The gamification strategy proved effective as a sophisticated framework for emotional processing. By externalizing struggles onto a character that thrives on challenges, users can reframe their relationship with failure and setbacks.</p>

                    <p>Moving forward, I would explore more robust AI integration earlier in the process and conduct longitudinal studies to validate the long-term effectiveness of the approach. The foundation established in this phase demonstrates strong potential for meaningful impact on learning persistence and emotional resilience.</p>
